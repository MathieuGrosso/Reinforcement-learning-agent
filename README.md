# Reinforcement-learning-agent


This repository contains a collection of different reinforcement learning projects, each implementing RL agent.

Each directory in this repository represents a distinct project, with its own agent and corresponding infrastructure. I have designed and implemented each of these projects.

## Projects

- `Actor-Critic`: Implements an Actor-Critic reinforcement learning agent.
- `DQN-experience-replay`: Implements a Deep Q-Network (DQN) agent with experience replay.
- `DynaQ-Qlearning`: Implements a combination of Dyna-Q and Q-Learning.
- `PPOKL`: Implements a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent using Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence.
- `Rld`: An older project implementing a unique reinforcement learning agent.
- `TME1env`: Contains an environment and corresponding agent for teaching purposes.
- `ddpg`: Implements a Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) agent.
- `dqn-igs-her`: Implements a DQN agent using Importance Sampling (IS) and Hindsight Experience Replay (HER).
- `gail`: Implements a Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL) agent.
- `gan`: Implements a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) agent.
- `gridworld-random-agent`: Implements a random agent in a Gridworld environment.
- `multi-agent`: Contains a multi-agent reinforcement learning project.
- `variational-encoder`: Implements a reinforcement learning agent with a Variational Autoencoder (VAE).

Feel free to explore each project's individual directory for more information about its structure and agent.
